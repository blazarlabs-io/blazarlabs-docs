# Adding DNS Records

Blazar Labs uses Godaddy as its DNS Provider.

1. Login to your Godaddy account and select your product domain.

2. Go to your DNS administration panel and click on **Add a new record**

3. Add a new A record, use the name you wish to use for your subdomain and input the server IP address on the data field.

4. After some time, your domain name or subdomain name should be pointing to your server's IP address.
